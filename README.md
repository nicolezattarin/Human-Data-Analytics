# Human-Data-Analytics

Collection of resources developed for the Human Data Analytics course at the University of Padova.

In particular, projects concern data anslysis by means of deep learning techinques.

## Overview

1. [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/nicolezattarin/Human-Data-Analytics/tree/main/CNN)

We provide two different implementations of a CNN for image classification using tensorflow and keras. The first is based on using the sequetial class from tensorflow, while the second relies on the model class. 

An example of possible dataset on which this can be applied follows:
